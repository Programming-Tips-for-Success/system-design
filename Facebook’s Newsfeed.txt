How to design Facebookâ€™s Newsfeed? What kind of algorithm will you use?

The newsfeed is an important part of Facebook that allows a user to see what's happening around the world, including friends, families, pages he has liked, a group he has followed, and of course, the Facebook ads.

The job of the newsfeed algorithm is to show messages that are most important to the user and which can generate high engagement. Obviously, messages from friends and family should take priority.
