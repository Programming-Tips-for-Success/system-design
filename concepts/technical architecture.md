5 useful Technical Architecture diagrams

Technical Architecture (TA) is a form of IT architecture that is used to design computer systems. It involves the development of a technical blueprint with regard to the arrangement, interaction, and interdependence of all elements so that system-relevant requirements are met.
A technical architecture diagram provides a bird's eye view of the infrastructure of your organisation

cloud computing, microservices, and distributed systems are adding another level of complexity to the IT landscape.

technical architects create blueprint schematics of technical solutions making sure that new products or systems meet specified requirements.

Technical Architecture, Enterprise Architecture, solution architecture

Enterprise Architecture can be defined as a strategic planning initiative that determines the overall IT direction of a company. By taking all entities of an enterprise into account, including its stakeholders, customers, teams, data, and technology, it creates a visual blueprint of a target architecture that is perfectly aligned with business interests and goals. In this process, EA takes inventory of all existing applications and their interdependencies in order to identify obsolete technologies, redundancies, and new business opportunities.

Technical architects focus on specific technologies and have a deep, ground-level understanding of their functions and limitations.

After enterprise and solution architects have designed a strategy and decided which IT solutions should be implemented, they delegate specific tasks to technical architects.

They help with understanding — provide an overview of the available systems and interaction, which facilitates impact assessment of changes easily.

They improve communication and collaboration — align implementation plans across projects and stakeholders to reduce gaps in communication. A useful architecture diagram should address each of the stakeholder’s needs to a certain extent.

A useful architecture diagram has a combination of these three components:

1-Standardised process flow of information, e.g. top-down reading — this indicates how the components interact with each other.

2-Provides sufficient information in components with logical groupings — this indicates where constraints lie, e.g. network boundaries.

3-Includes annotations with more information — steps with slightly more details to facilitate the implementation of solutions, e.g. process description.

5 useful Technical Architecture diagrams-
Application Architecture Diagram
As the name suggests, the application architecture diagram focuses on the applications within a computer system, microservices and how they interact with databases and each other. If an application needs to be replaced, upgraded or merged with other applications, technical architects can quickly assess how this will affect the system. With a single glance, they see which applications reside in shared container clusters, what their interactions and dependencies look like, and how the desired state of architecture can be reached.

Integration Architecture diagram
While the application architecture diagram deals with the “What” in relation to the system, the integration architecture diagram focuses on the “How” by emphasizing integration protocols between single components. This diagram comes in handy when an external partner system needs to be integrated into the existing one. With this diagram, technical architects are forced to think about how services are organized and how they’re exposed. If they’re exposed externally, it helps them decide on how they’ll be secured and tracked during and after the integration.

Deployment Architecture diagram
In the deployment architecture diagram, IT specialists depict the network boundaries as well as the infrastructure of hardware and software components. Since this diagram also tends to specify the quantity and size of components, it both addresses the questions “Where” and “How many”. In practice, the deployment architecture diagram is used to facilitate the upgrading of services or applications. This might be necessary when existing resources have become unable to handle the increasing scale and load caused by a growing number of users.

DevOps Architecture diagram
This diagram is used to optimize processes and deployment flows. By not only looking at the components but also at their processes, technical architects can identify weaknesses within the deployment process like non-standardized practices or bottlenecks. The diagram makes technical architects examine what kind of applications are deployed, what the current process flow looks like, and how configurations are managed across applications. Once these areas of improvement or integration points are uncovered, it’s easier to implement new tools.

Data Architecture diagram
With a data architecture diagram, technical architects visualize how data is collected, stored, processed, and used. It also helps them capture the flow of data between all the components that make up a system. Nowadays, businesses deal with an increasing amount of data that can quickly slow down the system or cause even bigger issues. A data architecture diagram is the first step to optimizing data collection and storage as it reveals where upgrades are needed and where costs can be lowered.
