Microservices have many benefits for Agile and DevOps teams.
Microservices is an approach to software architecture that builds a large, complex application from multiple small components.

Advantages-
• Less Complexity
• Less Coordination
• Separate Development and deployment
• Different Technologies
Disadvantages-
• UI Composition
• Distributed Data
• Distributed System

microservices are a style of service-oriented architecture (SOA) where the app is structured on an assembly of interconnected services. With microservices, the application architecture is built with lightweight protocols.

 Compared to its predecessor, the monolithic architecture, microservices are hands down more beneficial

Example-

The Order Service stores information about orders and the Customer Service stores information about customers.

 Event-driven: ‘Events of Node.js’ is a notification system that enables the application server to capture the response of the previous API call.

 NodeJS uses event-driven architectures built on a common pattern in software development known as publish-subscribe or observer pattern that enables powerful applications to be built, especially real-time applications.

 We can use a message pattern or an event pattern to communicate with the microservice. The message pattern acts like a request-response method. It is suitable for exchanging messages between services and the event pattern when you just want to publish events without waiting for a response.

 microservices - each service has its own database.

gRPC is a modern RPC that enables microservices to interact with each other.

 hot tables (single tables that are shared among multiple microservices)

how do two microservices communicate?

Microservices with docker, Kubernetes, kafka and mongoDB
