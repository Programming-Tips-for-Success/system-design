Distributed System

What do you mean by distributed system?
What do you mean by scaling in distributed system?                                                      
Differentiate between global state and local state?                                                          
What do you mean by casual ordering of messages?                                                      
What are the main difference between a Centralized system and Distributed system? 
The Network Time Protocol service can be used to synchronize computer clocks. Explain why, even with this service, no guaranteed bound is given for the difference between two clocks.                                                                                                                                
Suppose that a basic disk read can sometimes read values that are different from those written. State the type of failure exhibited by a basic disk read. Suggest how this failure may be masked in order to produce a different benign form of failure. Now suggest how to mask the benign failure.                                                                                                
Why is computer clock synchronization necessary? Describe the design requirements for a system to synchronize the clocks in a distributed system   
The figure shows events occurring for each of two processes, p1 and p2. Arrows between processes denote message transmission. Draw and label the lattice of consistent states (p1 state, p2 state), beginning with the initial state (0,0).         
  
Write down the performance of Lamportâ€™s algorithm for mutual exclusion?   
What do you mean by deadlock avoidance ? Explain in brief. Describe Edge-Chasing deadlock detection algorithm"                            
What is Vector Clock ? How this maintains causal ordering? Explain.
What are the advantages of vector clock over lamport clock?
What do you mean by distributed mutual exclusion?
Discuss any protocol which uses the time stamp to order critical section request and resolve conflict in simultaneous request for critical section exclusion?
What is the problem of distributed deadlock detection?
What are the differences in centralized, distributed and hierarchical control organization for distributed deadlock detection?
What do you mean by casual ordering of message?
If process P sends two messages M1 and M2 to another process Q,what problem may arise if the two messages are not received by recipient Q in the order they were sent by process P?
Develop an algorithm which guarantees the casual ordering of messages in distributed system?
