How to design a vending machine?
You need to write code to implement a vending machine that has a bunch of products, e.g. chocolates, candy, cold drinks, and accepts different coins, e.g. nickles, dimes, quarters, cent, etc. Make sure you insert a coin, get a product back, and get your change back. Also, write the unit test to demonstrate that these common use cases work.
